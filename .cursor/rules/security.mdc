# Security Considerations

## Input Validation and Sanitization

- Validate and sanitize untrusted input before parsing
- Set limits on input size to prevent DoS attacks
- Set limits on recursion depth to prevent stack overflow
- Be cautious about exposing parsers that could lead to excessive resource usage
- Document security implications for parsers that handle untrusted input

## Regular Expression Safety

- Avoid using regular expressions that may be vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking
- Test regex patterns with potentially malicious inputs
- Consider using finite automata instead of regex for complex patterns
- Document regex complexity and potential vulnerabilities

## Resource Management

- Implement timeout mechanisms for long-running parsing operations
- Set memory limits for parser operations
- Monitor and limit CPU usage during parsing
- Implement proper cleanup for allocated resources
- Consider parser cancellation mechanisms

## Secure Parsing Practices

- Validate parser inputs against expected schemas
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Use structured error reporting that provides useful debugging info without exposing internals
- Consider sandboxing for parsers that handle untrusted content
- Document security boundaries and trust assumptions
