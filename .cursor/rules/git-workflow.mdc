# Git Workflow and Development Process

## GitHub Issue Management

- Use GitHub Issues to track implementation plans and tasks
- Create issues for new features, bug fixes, and improvements
- Use issue templates for consistent formatting
- Assign issues to team members or yourself
- Use labels to categorize issues (e.g., feature, bug, enhancement, documentation)
- Link commits and pull requests to related issues using keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123", "Closes #456")
- Use the `gh` command for issue operations:
  - `gh issue create` - Create new issues
  - `gh issue list` - List existing issues
  - `gh issue view <number>` - View issue details
  - `gh issue close <number>` - Close completed issues
  - `gh issue edit <number>` - Edit issue details
- Keep issues updated with progress and status changes
- Use milestones to group related issues for releases
- Reference issues in commit messages and pull requests

## Git Workflow Standards

- Write clear and descriptive commit messages in English
- Use present tense in commit messages (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change
- Squash related changes before merging
- Use feature branches for new development
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable

## Commit Message Format

Use the following format for commit messages:
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Branch Management

- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/parser-optimization`, `fix/error-handling`)
- Delete feature branches after merging
- Keep feature branches up to date with main branch
- Use pull requests for code review
- Require at least one review before merging

## Code Review Process

- Review code for functionality, style, and security
- Check that tests are included and passing
- Verify documentation is updated
- Ensure compatibility with existing code
- Provide constructive feedback
- Test the changes locally when possible

## Pull Request Signature

All Pull Requests should include a signature at the end of the description to indicate when they were created with AI assistance:

```
---
*This Pull Request was created with assistance from Claude 4 Sonnet*
```

This signature should be added to:
- Pull request descriptions
- Significant commit messages when AI assistance was used
- Documentation changes made with AI assistance

## Release Process

- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Create release notes documenting changes
- Tag releases appropriately
- Test thoroughly before releasing
- Update changelog and documentation
- Coordinate releases with team members
