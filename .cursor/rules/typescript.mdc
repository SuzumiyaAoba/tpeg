# TypeScript Guidelines

## Code Style

- Follow TypeScript/JavaScript best practices
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
  - Use camelCase for variables and functions
  - Use PascalCase for classes and types
  - Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and deep nesting
- Use `prettier` and `biome` for consistent formatting
- Be explicit about types in TypeScript

## Type Safety

- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Avoid using `any` type - use specific types or unions instead
- Define proper interfaces for data structures
- Use generics for reusable type-safe functions
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing capabilities
- Use discriminated unions for complex state management
